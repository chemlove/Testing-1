Index of the scripts.

xclean: Cleans all the output files generated by ./xOPT or ./xSPM and so on; cleans queue files.

xoutPMF: Read the initial and final molecular distance from the .ot file of the first window.
plotpmf.py: Generate the free energy change curve with regard to coordinates.
            Calculate free energy of binding after volume correction.
            (Need to manually change the output file name: either plot it or save it.)
xplotPMF: Combine the above two.

xoutANH: Read the .ot files from SOS calculation. Generate sumout file.
         ***Only useful for normal SOS.***
xperlANH: Needs to be in the folder as the above one.


xANHZ: Automatically change the optimized zmat to Q and LJ part for FEP/SOS calculation.
       ***Usage:Dummy atoms can either by type -1 or 100. They are treated equally in the script.
          However, -1 type would not show up in Pymol or Rasmol.
          If a position restraint is applied onto a dummy atom, it has to be of type 100.
          In the optimized zmat, the numberinfo the atoms is suggested to be consecutive,
          since the maximum numbering is 100.
          In the optimized zmat, the RESIDUE NUMBER needs to be revised. Keep unchanged atoms as 0;
          if it's perturbed to 'DM' or sp3, RES = 2; if it's perturbed to 'D3' or sp2, RES = 3.
          Note that when the RES numbers are not all 0, ./xSPM would change all 0 to -1, 2 to 2, 3 to 3.
          Therefore, if something goes wrong with this script, run ./xSPM U-opt first and check sum file.
       ***Apply the restraints (if any) after the .Q and .LJ files are generated.  
       Sample: In AUTOZMAT folder, ./xANHZ U-opt 
QLJAUTO.f & QLJAUTO.out: These two needs to be in the same folder as xANHZ.
