Zmatrix Setup:

Use xANHZ to automate zmatrix setup. (Usage = ./xANHZ [zmat_name])

Prior to xANHZ use, the residue number in the original zmatrix must
be updated to reflect what type of atom that atom should ultimately
become: either an ideal sp3 or sp2 dummy atom.

Change residue number to "2" to indicate that the atom should be sp2
Change residue number to "3" to indicate that the atom should be sp3

xANHZ will output [zmat].Q.z & [zmat].LJ.z files.  ".Q.z" is ready 
for use in Q-aq/gas.  ".LJ.z" is ready for use in LJ-aq/gas.  In 
".LJ.z", the final atom types should be designated as D3 (sp2 atom)
or DM (sp3 atom).

Three examples are included: benzene, acetone, and methanol.  In 
each case, notice the residue number for each atom in the zmatrix.

[zmat].z = original zmatrix (with residue number = 2 or 3)
[zmat].Q.z & [zmat].LJ.z = output zmats by xANHZ


xANHZ can only be used on molecules containing 50 atoms or less.
xANHZ currently assumes that the input zmatrix contains CM1A charges.
(which means there's assigned charges and LJ parameters in the bottom
of zmat.)
If this is not the case, uncomment the appropriate lines in xANHZ.
